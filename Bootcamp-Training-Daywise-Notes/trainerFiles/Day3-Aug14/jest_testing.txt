How to test React App using Jest
Jest is a well-liked testing tool that makes
 it simple to test JavaScript applications, 
particularly those created using JavaScript-based 
frameworks like React.
It is an open-source technology that 
has won the trust of many developers 
and is supported by the tech giant Facebook. 

step1:

create a react project - npx create-react-app basic-app

cd basic app

npm run 
npm start


Step 2: Configure Jest into your project

Install react-test-renderer with the following command to render the JavaScript objects without DOM.

npm install react-test-renderer

npm install --save-dev jest


Step 3: Create a React application to perform testing

Letâ€™s create a React application for which we will write multiple tests using Jest. 

Write the following code inside the directory:

basic-app/src/components/HelloWorld.js.


import React from 'react'

function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
        <h1>
            Hello World
        </h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default HelloWorld

Also, update the basic-app/src/App.js file with the following script. 

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <HelloWorld/>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

After you have written the test file, follow the command to run the test on the root directory of your project ./basic-app.

npm test
