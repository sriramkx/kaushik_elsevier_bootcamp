Thespian PyPI is a Python library for 
building concurrent,
distributed, fault-tolerant
applications using the actor model. 
It helps you create actors that can handle 
specific tasks, communicate asynchronously, 
and manage state independently. 
It's mainly used for scenarios where you need to
 manage multiple tasks concurrently, 
scale across distributed systems, 
and ensure fault tolerance.

Kafka, on the other hand, 
is a distributed event streaming platform. 
It's used for building real-time data pipelines
and streaming applications. 
Kafka handles high-throughput, 
low-latency data streams and 
is often used for log aggregation,
messaging, and event sourcing.
