### Working with PyMongo / Introduction to NoSQL / MongoDB

#### **Introduction to NoSQL**
NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional SQL databases (relational databases), NoSQL databases are more flexible and can store data in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, and graphs. 

**Key Features of NoSQL:**
1. **Schema-less**: NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic changes to the data structure.
2. **Scalability**: They can scale horizontally, meaning you can add more servers to handle increased loads.
3. **Flexible Data Models**: NoSQL supports different data models like document, key-value, column-family, and graph-based models.
4. **High Availability**: They are designed for distributed environments, offering high availability and fault tolerance.

#### **Introduction to MongoDB**
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It’s document-oriented, meaning that each record (or document) is stored as a BSON object, which is similar to JSON. MongoDB is designed for high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

**Key Concepts in MongoDB:**
1. **Document**: A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. The values can be strings, numbers, arrays, or even nested documents.
2. **Collection**: A collection is a group of MongoDB documents, equivalent to a table in relational databases.
3. **Database**: A physical container for collections.
4. **BSON**: MongoDB’s binary representation of JSON-like documents.

#### **Working with PyMongo**
PyMongo is a Python library that allows you to interact with MongoDB databases. It provides a straightforward way to perform operations like inserting, querying, updating, and deleting documents.

**Installation:**
To install PyMongo, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

**Basic Operations with PyMongo:**

1. **Connecting to MongoDB:**

   ```python
   from pymongo import MongoClient

   # Connect to the MongoDB server running on localhost:27017
   client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)

   # Access a specific database
   db = client['mydatabase']
   ```

2. **Creating a Collection:**

   ```python
   # Access a collection (it will be created if it doesn’t exist)
   collection = db['mycollection']
   ```

3. **Inserting Documents:**

   - **Single Document:**
     ```python
     document = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
     collection.insert_one(document)
     ```

   - **Multiple Documents:**
     ```python
     documents = [
         {"name": "Bob", "age": 30, "city": "San Francisco"},
         {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35, "city": "Los Angeles"}
     ]
     collection.insert_many(documents)
     ```

4. **Querying Documents:**

   - **Find a Single Document:**
     ```python
     result = collection.find_one({"name": "Alice"})
     print(result)
     ```

   - **Find Multiple Documents:**
     ```python
     results = collection.find({"age": {"$gt": 25}})
     for doc in results:
         print(doc)
     ```

5. **Updating Documents:**

   - **Update a Single Document:**
     ```python
     collection.update_one(
         {"name": "Alice"},
         {"$set": {"age": 26}}
     )
     ```

   - **Update Multiple Documents:**
     ```python
     collection.update_many(
         {"city": "New York"},
         {"$set": {"city": "Boston"}}
     )
     ```

6. **Deleting Documents:**

   - **Delete a Single Document:**
     ```python
     collection.delete_one({"name": "Alice"})
     ```

   - **Delete Multiple Documents:**
     ```python
     collection.delete_many({"city": "Boston"})
     ```

7. **Indexes:**
   - Indexes can be created to improve query performance.
   ```python
   collection.create_index([("name", 1)])
   ```

#### **Example Program Using PyMongo:**

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)
db = client['company']
employees = db['employees']

# Insert documents
employees.insert_many([
    {"name": "John", "position": "Manager", "age": 30},
    {"name": "Jane", "position": "Developer", "age": 25},
    {"name": "Doe", "position": "Analyst", "age": 27}
])

# Query documents
results = employees.find({"age": {"$gte": 26}})
for doc in results:
    print(doc)

# Update documents
employees.update_one({"name": "John"}, {"$set": {"position": "Senior Manager"}})

# Delete documents
employees.delete_one({"name": "Doe"})

# Create an index
employees.create_index([("name", 1)])

client.close()
```
